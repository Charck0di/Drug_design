# Cyclodextrin–Drug Inclusion Complexes

This repository contains an integrated **meta-analysis and molecular modeling** study of cyclodextrin–drug inclusion complexes aimed at improving drug solubility and bioavailability.

## Overview

Cyclodextrins are widely used in drug formulation to enhance pharmacokinetics. This project combines:

* Meta-analysis of **Cmax** and **AUC** effect sizes from 11 studies
* Molecular docking
* Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
* Binding free energy calculations

to evaluate the performance and stability of different cyclodextrin–drug systems.

## Key Findings

* Overall improvement in drug exposure with substantial study heterogeneity
* **SBE-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD)** showed the strongest bioavailability enhancement
* **γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CD)** was consistently the least effective
* Stronger binding and higher stability observed for SBE-β-CD across all tested ligands

## Molecular Systems

Ligands selected based on solubility (logS):

* Atorvastatin
* β-Caryophyllene
* Koumine
* Compound K

MD simulations confirmed greater host–guest stability for **SBE-β-CD**, attributed to its extended hydrophobic cavity and favorable molecular shape.

## Conclusion

This study provides a mechanistic and statistical basis for rational cyclodextrin selection in drug formulation. While computational results are promising, further clinical validation is required.
